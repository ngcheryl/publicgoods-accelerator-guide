# Who is supporting DPGs and how do I engage with them?

## Who are the main stakeholders involved in supporting DPGs on a country and global level?
Who do I need to speak with in order to support startups who are looking to take their product as a Digital Public Good? It is key for accelerators to understand who is supporting DPGs, who can you could contact to facilitate discussion and support for DPGs in terms of funding? 

## Engaging at the Government Level
### Entrepreneurship development funds/agency
These are government agencies or entities that works with the startup ecosystem in terms of policy development, funding other partners in the ecosystems such as incubators and accelerators.

_Why should I care as an accelerator?_
* They can connect you to other ecosystem players – relevant funding firms, such as private funding, angel investors, and connect to other relevant startups who could complement a DPG you are supporting
* Potentially co-fund your program to support DPGs.
* Connect to other relevant ministries that can support the DPG or find a use case for the startup product/solution in the public infrastructure.

_What's in it for them?  How can I bring value to this stakeholder and conversation?_
* Presenting the current case study and evident public solutions deployed in other countries & success 
* Presenting a minimum basket of DPGs – that would be related to sharing this with other ministries
* Potential for local startups to be highlighted as Digital Public Good, media surrounded around innovation & startups
* Connecting to other entrepreneurship government agencies globally through UNICEF & DPGA network

_**See case study in the section of  "Accelerators Supporting DPGs" - UNICEF Kazakhstan and Astana Hub" in the guide.**_

### Ministries
These can be specific ministries that a DPG can implement and co-develop into their Digital Public Infrastructure, such as the Ministry of Science Technology Innovation or equivalent, Ministry of Education or equivalent, Ministry of Economy and Finance or equivalent, Ministry of ICT or equivalent.

_Why should I care as an accelerator?_
* Opportunity for startups that you support to be implemented on a government level, whether it's municipal, provincial or national.  
* Understand what the government priorities are that potential DPGs can be implemented into the digital public infrastructure.

_What's in it for them?  How can I bring value to this stakeholder and conversation?_
* Presenting the current case study and evident public solutions deployed in other countries & success 
* Presenting a minimum basket of DPGs – that would be related to sharing this with other ministries
* Potential promotion for a callout on digital public solutions in collaboration with your accelerator to identify solutions that can be implemented
* Potential for local startups to be highlighted as Digital Public Good, media surrounded around innovation & startups
* Connecting to other ministries globally through UNICEF & DPGA network

_**Example - [UNICEF and WHO Launch COVID Digital Health Centre of Excellence (DICE)](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/blog/unicef-and-who-launch-covid-digital-health-centre-of-excellence-dice-to-support-global-goods-for-covid-19-response-and-recovery/) to Support Global Goods for COVID-19 Response and Recovery**_

## Engaging with Private Sector
### Corporations or SMEs
These are private sector companies that can be sector agnostic, but have a corporate social responsibility or social innovation arm.

_Why should I care as an accelerator?_
* These corporations can also be potential partners to help fund the programming in monetary or other non-monetary benefits.
* Collaborating or partnering with a corporation may give more visibility and branding to your accelerator.
* They can bring specific expertise to your accelerator, especially on open source business and technical mentorship.

_What's in it for them?  How can I bring value to this stakeholder and conversation?_
* Presenting the current case study and evident public solutions deployed in other countries & success - see Accelerator Case studies section. 
* If the corporate is focused on CSR, by partnering with your accelerator on DPGs, they are supporting solutions that are relevant to the SDGs and a chance for their employees to be engaged through mentoring the startups as well.
* The DPG solutions that are supported by your accelerator could potentially present itself as a business solution relevant to challenges of the corporate of SMEs.

## Engaging with Local Community
Listed below are recommendations from UNICEF Ghana from their experience engaging with the local community.

- Find open-source developer groups (e.g. grouped around Open Street Maps; GIS; Linux)
- These groups are often found at ICT/Technology universities or faculties. Especially in developing countries these groups tend to be small to moderate, which means that by identifying a single person involved in the local OS scene you are exposed to the entire community
- Track OS-related events, for example Global Software Freedom Day (example in Ghana)
- Basic desktop research is a good first step: search for institutions, government agencies, event speakers, technologists, developers, who over the last 2-3 years vocally supported OS in interviews, on LinkedIn, or on social media
- Reach out to FSF (Free Software Foundation), inquire/search for communities/members focused on specific countries/continents. Again, usually one relevant person is enough for an exposure to an entire community.

### OS Developers & IT Community
### Other accelerators or incubators

## Engaging with Investors
### Private Investors 
These can be Venture Capitalists, Angel Investors, Accelerated funding or others that are looking for a return on their investment (not grant based).  Although private capital funding has been limited to date, some DPGs that are for-profit social businesses have taken the interim steps to becoming investable. 

For more information on engaging with private investors and investment cases for Digital Public Goods, please head to the section "Investment Cases of Private Funded Open Source Business Models" of the guide.

_Why should I care as an accelerator?_
* To understand which type of investors or investment thesis would be most applicable for the startup in your portfolio.  
* Build the most relevant information in an investment pitch/case for private investors – based on evidence and previous investment cases of other DPGs and open source businesses.

_What's in it for them?  How can I bring value to this stakeholder and conversation?_
* Presenting the potential scale and return of the open source business and DPG to an investor.  
* It is recommended from previous interviews on UNICEF DPG Private Investment Cases project by Deloitte, not to necessarily mention DPG, unless there are questions directly about the social impact, but to focus on the business model and investment case.  
* If the conversation on open source challenges comes up with an investor, you can present them the [Page 9 in this deck: Challenges in investing in DPGs with Mitigations & Examples](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qmY70vws9phoqh2_VpwTr0jjLKrN5jGF/view?usp=sharing).

## Engaging with UN Agencies
Our network of UN Agencies gives the ability for startups to scale in terms of implementation of their project/solution.  If there are specific country offices you'd like to get in touch with, please reach out directly to our programme team for the connection, Cheryl Ng, Startup Ecosystem Consultant, cng@unicef.org. 

## Engaging with DPGA
Digital Public Goods Alliance (DPGA) is a multi-stakeholder initiative where the team can assist when the startup is ready for a DPG nomination.  To find out if the startup is ready for a DPG nomination, they can take the [eligibility questionnaire](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/eligibility/) before nominating.  This process normally takes about 1-2 months depending if the startup has good documentation on their project and privacy protection and data security. The basic technical requirement would be having an open source license, amongst 8 other indicators.  **It is highly recommended that someone with great product knowledge take lead in the nomination process, working together with the lead developer work,** as it requires documents to show evidence for the 9 indicators. 

_Why should I care as an accelerator?_
* Once the DPGA has considered the nomination, they will be in touch for further follow up on documentation or evidence for the DPG criteria. 
* DPGA has a network of global experts in their Communities of Practice which can help better the project but also identify opportunities worldwide on potential customers and partners for the DPG. 

_What's in it for them?  How can I bring value to this stakeholder and conversation?_
* Accelerators could potentially participate or contribute to the [DPGA Roadmap](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11COD41W7VkDUVGgBFUSCCQatU3Hvj4du/view?usp=sharing), on providing opportunities that accelerate the DPGs.  The [DPGA annual roadmap](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/roadmap/) is a transparent coordination, alignment, engagement and communication tool capturing stakeholder activities that significantly advance DPGA strategic objectives.  This could be potential helping source, identify and support DPGs.
