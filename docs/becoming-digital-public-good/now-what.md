# You have become a DPG!  Now, what?

## Digital Public Goods Alliance (DPGA) 
Once a project becomes a DPG and is listed in the DPG Registry, there will be opportunities to collaborate with the DPGA to promote your project/startup to the DPGA ecosystem through social, newsletters and additional relevant communications (blogs, talks, papers). Presence in the registry is also a prerequisite for being highlighted by a community of practice which could provide additional exposure. The DPGA also strives to take note of new DPGs and makes relevant connections where they see them within the ecosystem. The DPGA has no direct mechanism to provide funding to individual DPGs, but does work with high-level donors to prioritize funding for the DPG ecosystem and to create new mechanisms to support DPGs. Today, funding continues to be through those donors and their specific programs i.e. [Digital Square's](https://digitalsquare.org/solicitations) open application process. 

## UNICEF Country Office 
Working with UNICEF's country office or local UN agencies, there can be potential synergies on public solutions that projects are in need of. For example, by understanding what the priorities are within each project or programme team in various UN agencies located in that particular country, there could potentially be a fit for a solution within that UN country office or connections to other local NGOs that would be in need of a DPG.  

## Funding for DPGs 
The UNICEF DPG team is currently working closely with the UNICEF Venture Fund and DPGA to bring together potential investors and give more opportunities to highlight DPGs to the investment community.

## Next Steps: New DPGs
The following are steps that the UNICEF office and DPGA have been working on with new DPGs.  

1. A follow up call with DPGs and the UNICEF DPG team to better understand their business goals and guide them through developing a country onboarding process (a presentation deck explaining the use cases of DPGs, adoption requirements, technical assistance available, etc). DPGs should present an updated deck with their expansion plans and modalities for scaling. UNICEF's DPG team will guide teams on how to be technically ready for multi-country scale, as well as leveraging the value of being a DPG (building and maintaining a community, accessing technical and financial resources). 

2. Based on the team's business plans + onboarding process, the UNICEF DPG team will make introductions to specific countries of interest. 

3. A public update on how UNICEF pathfinder DPGs are scaling and being adopted in other contexts.
