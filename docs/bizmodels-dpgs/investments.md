### Mission
To make global supply chains resilient and sustainable by connecting data silos, and thereby reducing wastage

### Description
StaTwig develops a platform that connects all stakeholders in the value chain. It provides real-time tracking and visibility of the life journey of a product, including geographical location, changes in temperature, along with all transactions, contracts and payments associated with the product as it moves through the supply chain, enabling clients to trace products from manufacturer to customer by using loT devices that tag along with the product. 

Products: VaccineLedger (vaccine supply chain), FoodLedger, Brewcollect (AB Inbev), Cargoledger (air cargo terminals), Sensostat (Internet of Things data capture) 

* **_Key challenge solving for:_** The information systems used by various stakeholders do not talk to each other leading to supply chain failures such as counterfeiting, diversion, black marketing, cold-chain failures and stock outs
* **_Advantage of open-source technology:_** StaTwig focuses on the (international) development sector in which clients (UN, governments) value companies that are open source. Additionally, in the future a community of developers can be engaged to accelerate the development and adoption of the software.
* **_Level of open-source technology in business model:_** 100%
* **_Status:_** generating revenue (2021 is 1st year of sales after VaccineLedger was tested and LTA signed with UNICEF in Sep 2020)

### **Business Model Canvas**
**Activities**
* Development of VaccineLedger, focused on vaccine supply chains, with unique digital IDs for every vaccine and unit level track and trace 
* Development of FoodLedger, Brewcollect (AB Inbev), Cargoledger (aircargo terminals), Sensostat (Internet of Things data capture) 

**Customers**
* All stakeholders in the supply chain can be a paying customer (suppliers, original equipment manufacturers, distributors and retail clients) 
* Currently, StaTwig focuses on the vaccination vertical, and within that on donors of large vaccination distribution programs (e.g. UNICEF) or producers of vaccines (e.g. AstraZeneca) 

**Value provided**
* The FoodLedger combats hunger and saves money by tracking and reducing wastage of rice bags from farmers to beneficiaries in the Telangana state government subsidized food grain program 
* For donors, the VaccineLedger reduces wastage and improves the efficiency of large vaccination distribution programs by creating better visibility and traceability of money spend and by preventing cold chain failures and stock outs 
* For suppliers, the VaccineLedger leads to higher compliance rates on transparency regulation and to reduced risk of counterfeits and black-marketing 

**Resources**
* Blockchain technology that distributes and decentralizes the data 
* Team of supply chain specialists and tech developers 

**Customer Relations**
* User apps
* User websites

**Channels**
* Works with technological and logistical channel partners such as: Apollo logisolutions, IDB, Tech mahindra, MAERSK, GAAR 
* Works with vendors to offer a range of Internet of Things devices to measure product location and conditions throughout the value chain 

**Partners**
* Internet of Things vendor partners 
* Technological / supply chain channel partners 
* Funding partners, like IFC, development banks, international donor organizations (e.g. UNICEF) 

**Cost**
* Personnel costs: development team mainly, a bit of sales and marketing
* Procurement costs: Internet of Things decives from 3rd party suppliers / vendors

**Revenue**
* Average revenue of 0.1 USD for each stock-keeping unit (e.g. vaccine) tracked 
* Clients pay for Blockchain information that they extract out of the system at each stage, so they subscribe to touchpoints along the product’s journey (e.g. airport, warehouse, etc.) 
* Revenue from consulting services, namely offering of virtual tech modules (e.g. visualization, analytics, to predict & prevent) 

### _**Comments & Insights**_
* UNICEF could focus more on the development of strong business models when incubating start-ups; in the end, venture capital firms focus on revenue growth and profit when making investment decisions. Companies that are “shy” to generate revenue will not develop sustainable business models 
* UNICEF can provide additional value to their fund graduates by marketing them as impactful and scalable investment opportunities. Showcasing commercial successes of its fund graduates could spark interest of investors 
* In the investor pitch, it is not necessary to mention that the business is based on open source technology. Market fit and growth are more relevant. Potential responses to venture capitalists that are hesitant to invest in open source could be: 
    * “We already work (exclusively) with very large clients like UNICEF that value open source” 
    * “We can scale and develop our product more rapidly when we engage a community of developers (like university students)” 
    * “Large governments and/ or international donor organizations have a large mandate for open source”
